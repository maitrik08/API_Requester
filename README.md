# Api_requester

Project Definition: API Requester

Project Description:
The "API Requester" project is designed to help students learn how to interact with external APIs using two different packages, http and dio, in a Flutter application. The project aims to demonstrate various methods of API integration while following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to promote clean code organization. Additionally, students will implement state management using either the Provider or GetX package.
This project is an excellent opportunity for students to understand how to manage API calls efficiently, handle responses, and integrate them into a Flutter app. By working on this project, students will become familiar with two popular packages for HTTP requests, allowing them to choose the best tool for their future projects. Moreover, by following the MVC pattern and incorporating state management, students will learn best practices for building scalable and maintainable applications.
Project Features:
- API Integration: Students must call an external API to create a News App using both the http and dio packages.
- MVC Architecture: The project must follow the MVC pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns between the Model, View, and Controller.
State Management: Students are required to implement state management using either Provider or GetX to handle the app's state efficiently.
Error Handling: Students should implement proper error handling for failed API requests and network errors.
- UI Display: The retrieved data from the API must be displayed on the UI in a user-friendlymanner, and any loading or error states must be managed accordingly. Implement HomePage and DetailPage. Also, filter the news category-wise.
Comparison of Packages: Students should document the differences in using http and dio for API requests, comparing aspects such as ease of use, features, and performance.
Project Technologies:
Dart language
- Flutter framework with MVC and Provider architecture
http Package: A Flutter package used for making simple API requests.
- dio Package: A more advanced HTTP client for handling requests with additional features.
